                    Spam, also known as junk mail, is an unsolicited commercial email message, commonly sent in bulk email messages. “Unsolicited” means that the recipient has not consented to the message being sent. “Bulk” means that the message is sent as part of a larger collection of messages, all having substantively identical content. The term 'spamming' refers to transmitting, distributing or delivering any unwanted commercial e-mail correspondence, especially in mass quantities, through the electronic means of communication.
